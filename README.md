# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Abalysis

## Overview
This repository contains a exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. This work aims to provide a clear understanding of the data structure and relationships within the dataset.

## Dataset
Source: Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Files
Titanic_Dataset.csv: The original dataset

## Analysis steps and usage
Used Python and the libraries ï»¿pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and seaborn in Jupyter Notebook. Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.). Created histograms and boxplots for numeric features. Used pairplot ,atrix and correlation matrix for feature relationships. Identified patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data. Made basic feature-level inferences from visuals.

## Results
Higher-class passengers (1st class) and females have higher survival rates. 

Younger passengers (e.g., children) seem to have better survival rates. 

Passengers who paid higher fares are more likely to survive.
